# Gravity glitch network
The proposed network is composed by four branches, one for each image view, merged together by two fully-connected layers. 

It is used for glitch classification in time-frequency images of gravitational waves.

## Dataset
The dataset is composed by spectrogram images of gravitational waves affected by random noise, causing the presence of glitches.

It includes 7881 instances with label from 22 classes.

The dataset is split in:
- 6093 instances for training;
- 667 instances for validation;
- 1121 instances for test.
